<h1> 1.0 Networks and Protocols (IP, DNS, HTTP , TCP , etc). </h1> </br>
 </br>

Protocols is a fancy word that has a meaning  in English totally independent of computer  science. </br>
It means a system of rules and regulations 
that govern  something.  A kind of official procedure or official way  something must be done. 

For people to connect to machines and code that communicate  with each other. they need a network over which such communciation 
can take place. </br> But the communication  also needs some rules, structure,and agreed upon procedures. </br>

Thus, network protocols are protocols that govern how machines  and software communicate over given network. An example  of a network
is our beloved world wide web.
