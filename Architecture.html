This come up a lot during  developer job interviews especially at big tech companies  </br>
This in depth-guide will help prepare You to start getting familiar with these terms, by teaching you basic software
architecture concepts. </br>

This is not a certification course, Since system design is a vast  topic. But if you are a junior or mid level developer, 
this should give you a strong fundation. </br>

From there you can dig deeper with other resources .  </br>
Below are listed  some of the resources that have been considered  to be important to start . </br>

Additionaly, This Guide has been broken into bite-size chunks by topic and so i recommend you to bookmark it. </br>
I've found space learning  and repetition  to be incredibly valuable  tools to learn  and retain 
information. And this guide has been designed  to be chuncked down into pieces that are easy to do spaced repetition with. </br> </br>

<h1> 1.0 Networks and Protocols (IP, DNS, HTTP , TCP , etc). </h1> </br>
 </br>

Protocols is a fancy word that has a meaning  in English totally independent of computer  science. </br>
It means a system of rules and regulations 
that govern  something.  A kind of official procedure or official way  something must be done. 

For people to connect to machines and code that communicate  with each other. they need a network over which such communciation 
can take place. </br> But the communication  also needs some rules, structure,and agreed upon procedures. </br>

Thus, network protocols are protocols that govern how machines  and software communicate over given network. An example  of a network
is our beloved world wide web.

 </br>
You May have hear  of the most common network protocols on the internet era things like HTTP, TCP/ IP etc. Lets break them down into basics.

</br> 

<h1>IP Internet Protocol</h1>

  Think of this is a fundamental layer of protocols. It is the basic protocol that instructs us on how almost all communication
 across internet networks must be implemented.</br>

Messages over IP are often communicated in packets, which  are small bundles of information(2ex 16bytes). Each packethas an essential
structure made up of two components: The header and the Data.

The Header contains "meta" data about the packet and its data. This metadata includes information such as the IP address of the source (where the packet cames from) and
the destination IP address (destination of the packet), Clearly  this is fundamental to being able to send information from one point
to another - you need the from and to addresses.


The other protocols we will consider in this post are built on top of IP, just like your favourite software language has libraries 
and frameworks built on the top of it.

<h1> TCP- Transmission Control Protocol </h1>

</br> </br>
TCP is a utility built on top of IP .</br>
TCP was created  to solve a problem with IP. Data over IP is typically sent in multiple packets
because each packet is farily small (2exp16bytes). Multiple packets can resultin (A) lost or dropped
packets and (B) disordered packets, thus corruption the transmitted data. TCP solves both of these by guaranteeing
transmission of packet in order waty </br>


Being built on the top of the IP ,the packet has a header called TCP  header in addition to the IP header.This TCP 
header contains information about the orderging of packets, and the number of packets and so on. This ensures that the data 
is reliably received at the other end, It is generally referredto as TCP/IP because it is built on the top of the IP.

TCP needs to establish a connection between source and destination before it transmits the packets, and it does via 
a handshake. This connection itself is established using packets where the source informs the destination that it wants
to open a connection , and the destination says OK, and the conection is opened.

This, in effect. is what happens when a server "listens" a port - just before it starts  to listen  there
is a handshake, and then the conection is opened (listening starts). Simiarly, one sends the other a message that is about
to close the connection, and that ends the connection.

<br/>

HTTP -Hypertext Transfer Protocol </br>

HTTP is a protocol that is an abstraction built on top of TCP/IP . It introduces a very important pattern called the request- response
pattern, specifically for client server interactions. </br>

A client is simply a machine or system that request information, and a server is a machine or system that responds with information. <(br>
A browser is a client, and a web-server is a server. </br>

When a server request data from another server then the first server is also a client, and the second server is the server .</br>

So this  request-response cycle has its own rules under HTTP and this standarizes  how information is transmitted  across the internet. <>
 </br>

At this level of abstraction we typically  dont need to worry  too much about IP and TCP</br>
However, HTTP, request and responses have headers and bodies too, and these contain data that can be set by the developer. </br>


HTTP request and responses can be thought of as messages with key value pairs , very similar to objects in Java Script  and dictionaries 
in Python , but not the same. </br>
